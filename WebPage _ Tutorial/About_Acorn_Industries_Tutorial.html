	<h2>Product Vision:</h2>

	<p>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create tentative schedules that takes into consideration the difficultly of classes so that students can make use of it once they have decided on a major. These schedules take into consideration the difficulty of the classes. The consideration of the difficulty result in a balanced schedule that allow the students to advance in their major while reducing the burden of having to research the classes they want to take.</span>
	</p>

	<h2>Product Mission:</h2>

	<p>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide a desktop application that can be used by students majoring in any of the three fields offered by the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Texas at Arlington. The desktop application helps students reduce the burden of having to research the classes they want to take by creating balanced schedule for each semester.</span>
	</p>

	<h2>Success Criteria:</h2>

	<p>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">This idea was generated from the need of students to plan their academic schedule in a way that allows them to advance in the major while reducing the difficulty of each semester. New students in particular will benefit from this application since it will provide them with a guide on how to structure their academic work through each semester. Both students that decide to take the classes suggested by the application, and those that have not used the schedule will benefit from its suggestions and hopefully understand how to create their own schedule.</span>

	<ul>
		<li>The degree planner can be saved to continue at a later date.</li>
		<li>The system can load a preexisting degree planner file.</li>
		<li>Generate a sample degree plan for Computer Science Students at UT Arlington.</li>
	<li>Allow students to select courses for any semester they would like to ease the process for advisor/student appointments.</li>
	</ul>
